# keyboard-chatter-fix
I have a logitech G810 keyboard experiencing severe keyboard chatter.
The fix will limit the rate of the keyboard and is not suitable for gamers.

## Windows
Registry patch for Windows.
The patch applies the fix to the current user and the default "user" (the user for Windows login screen).
The patch has only been tested on Windows 10.
